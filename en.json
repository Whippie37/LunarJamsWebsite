        "So, What's a Lunar Jam?",
        "Lunar Jam is a Platformer Jam-Basically think of it as a mini-creator contest.<br><br>The idea is to make a fast, simple level focused on enjoyability and uniqueness based on a given theme, rather than the absolute highest effort project possible like with a normal contests.<br><br>Because of this, Jam deadlines are very short, usually only a couple of days, meaning you'll have to make the most of your time.<br><br><br>This event is inspired by Game Jams such as the GMTK Game Jam, which are periodic events where game developers come together to create a game under an extremely limited timeframe to create a full game based around a given theme.<br><br>"
